== Samples

There are numerous samples in the {github-tree}/samples[`samples`] subfolder of the root project.
These show the feature in use with different technologies.

Most of them use Spring Boot Buildpacks support (Maven for most of the sample except the `webmvc-kotlin` one which is using Gradle).
There are also `build.sh` and other related Bash scripts used for development and CI.

Beware that native image compilation can takes a long time and eats RAM.

The samples show the wide variety of tech that is working fine: Spring MVC with Tomcat, Spring WebFlux with Netty, Thymeleaf, JPA, and others.
The Petclinic samples brings multiple technologies together in one application.

If you are starting to build your first Spring Boot application, we recommend you follow one of the getting started guides.
