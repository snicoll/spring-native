== Support

This section defines the GraalVM version, languages and dependencies that have been validated against Spring Native {version}.

[[support-graalvm]]
=== GraalVM

GraalVM version {graalvm-version} is supported, see the related https://www.graalvm.org/release-notes/[release notes].
GraalVM issues impacting the Spring ecosystem are identified on their issue tracker using https://github.com/oracle/graal/labels/spring[the `spring` label].

[[support-language]]
=== Language

Java 8, Java 11, and Kotlin 1.3+ are supported.

NOTE: Java 11 native images are currently impacted by a transient footprint issue that may lead (or not) to bigger images due to https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/3163[oracle/graal#3163].

Kotlin Coroutines are supported but require additional reflection entries due to how Coroutines generates bytecode with an `Object` return type, see https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/21546[this related issue] for a potential future fix.

[[support-feature-flags]]
=== Feature flags

Some features like HTTPS may require some additional flags, check <<native-image-options>> for more details.
When it recognizes certain usage scenarios, Spring Native tries to set required flags automatically.

[[support-spring-boot]]
=== Spring Boot

IMPORTANT: `spring-native` {version} is designed to be used with Spring Boot {spring-boot-version}.

The following starters are supported, the group ID is `org.springframework.boot` unless specified otherwise.

* `spring-boot-starter-actuator`: WebMvc and WebFlux are supported, as well as metrics and tracing infrastructure.
Beware that actuators significantly increase the footprint, this will be optimized in a future release.
* `spring-boot-starter-data-elasticsearch`
* `spring-boot-starter-data-jdbc`
* `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`
** You need to configure https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.4/topical/html_single/bytecode/BytecodeEnhancement.html#_build_time_enhancement[Hibernate build-time bytecode enhancement]
** `hibernate.bytecode.provider=none` is automatically set
* `spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb`
* `spring-boot-starter-data-neo4j`
* `spring-boot-starter-data-r2dbc`
* `spring-boot-starter-data-redis`
* `spring-boot-starter-jdbc`
* `spring-boot-starter-logging`
* `spring-boot-starter-mail`
* `spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf`
* `spring-boot-starter-rsocket`
* `spring-boot-starter-validation`
* `spring-boot-starter-security`: WebMvc and WebFlux form login, HTTP basic authentication and OAuth 2.0 are supported.
RSocket security is also supported.
* `spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server`: WebMvc and WebFlux are supported.
* `spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client`: WebMvc and WebFlux are supported.
* `spring-boot-starter-webflux`: only Netty is supported for now.
* `spring-boot-starter-web`:
** Only Tomcat is supported for now.
** `--enable-https` flag is required for HTTPS support.
** `org.apache.tomcat.experimental:tomcat-embed-programmatic` dependency can be used instead of `tomcat-embed-core` and `tomcat-embed-websocket` ones for optimized footprint.
* `spring-boot-starter-websocket`
* `com.wavefront:wavefront-spring-boot-starter`

IMPORTANT: Devtools is not supported yet, you can follow
https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-native/issues/532[spring-native#532] to be aware when it will.

[[support-spring-cloud]]
=== Spring Cloud

IMPORTANT: `spring-native` {version} is designed to be used with Spring Cloud {spring-cloud-version}.

Group ID is `org.springframework.cloud`.

NOTE: When using Spring Native, `spring.cloud.refresh.enabled` is set to `false` for compatibility and footprint reasons. `spring.sleuth.async.enabled` is also set to `false` since this feature leads to too much proxies created for a reasonable footprint.

* `spring-cloud-starter-bootstrap`
* `spring-cloud-starter-config`
* `spring-cloud-config-client`
* `spring-cloud-function-web`
** `--enable-https` flag is required for HTTPS support.
* `spring-cloud-function-adapter-aws`
* `spring-cloud-starter-function-webflux`
** `--enable-https` flag is required for HTTPS support.

[[support-others]]
=== Others

* Spring Kafka
* https://grpc.io/[GRPC]
* H2 database
* Mysql JDBC driver
* PostgreSQL JDBC driver

[[support-limitations]]
=== Limitations

CGLIB proxies are not supported, only JDK dynamic proxies on interfaces are supported for now. As a consequence `spring.aop.proxy-target-class` is set to `false` when using Spring Native.

NOTE: If you are using `@Configuration` without setting `proxyBeanMethods=false` and use only method parameters to inject bean dependencies, Spring Native handles that scenario so that a CGLIB proxy is not required.
