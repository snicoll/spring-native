/**
 * {@link NativeHint} annotations should be placed either on Spring configuration/registrar/import-selectors or on some
 * implementation of {@code NativeConfiguration} that the system will discover via a service factory load.
 *
 * <p>This allows hints to be provided for pre-compiled sources that don't yet have hints provided.
 * A {@link NativeHint} determines what needs to be accessible at runtime in a native image (via reflection or via
 * resource access). {@link NativeHint} typically have a trigger that activates them and that would be if a particular
 * piece of configuration/registrar or import-selector is determined to be active in a Spring application. The trigger
 * is either inferred (if the hint is on a piece of Spring configuration/registrar/import-selector) or it can be specified
 * by setting the `trigger` member of the annotation (for hints provided separately to the Spring configuration).
