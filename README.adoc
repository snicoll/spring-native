Spring Native provides an incubating support for compiling Spring applications to native executables using https://www.graalvm.org[GraalVM] 
https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/[native-image] compiler, in order to provide a native deployment
option designed to be packaged in lightweight containers. In practice, the target is to support your Spring application
(typically a Spring Boot one), unmodified, on this new platform.

It is mainly composed of:

- `spring-native`: this module contains the runtime dependency required for running Spring native like the substitutions.
- `spring-native-configuration`: this module contains configuration hints for Spring classes, including various Spring Boot auto-configurations.
- `spring-native-docs`: contains the asciidoc documentation sources.
- `spring-native-tools`: tools used for reviewing image building configuration and output.
- `spring-aot`: this module contains the AOT transformation infrastructure common to Maven and Gradle plugins.
- `spring-aot-gradle-plugin`: this module contains the Gradle plugin that invokes AOT transformations.
- `spring-aot-maven-plugin`: this module contains the Maven plugin that invokes AOT transformations.
- `samples`: contains various samples that demonstrate the feature usage and are used as integration tests.

== Scope and status

This project status is alpha, which means that we are currently mainly working on the software design and on supporting the features of the current samples (work in progress).
Supporting a wider range of Spring Boot applications, as well as optimizing efficiency (image size, memory consumption) and performances will happen as a second step.

Some changes incubated here are moved directly to https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/labels/type%3A%20native[Spring Framework] and https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/labels/theme%3A%20native[Spring Boot] projects.

== Quick start

For detailed information and walkthroughs of applying the techniques to your project, please see the {documentation-url}[documentation].

=== Artifacts

The latest {version} release supports GraalVM {graalvm-version} and Spring Boot {spring-boot-version}.

- Artifact: https://repo.spring.io/{repository}/org/springframework/experimental/spring-graalvm-native/{version}/spring-graalvm-native-{version}.jar[`org.springframework.experimental:spring-graalvm-native:{version}`]
- Repository: https://repo.spring.io/{repository}[`https://repo.spring.io/{repository}`]

=== Play with the samples

NOTE: You need to install the GraalVM `native-image` compiler, check {documentation-url}/#getting-started-native-image[the documentation] for more details.

- Download and extract https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-native/archive/{version}.zip[sources from the latest release].
- Go into the samples folder and pick one (e.g. `cd samples/commandlinerunner`)
- Run `./build.sh` which will run a maven build, then a native image compile, then test the result.

`build.sh` runs the `compile.sh` script and in that compile script you can see the invocation of the `native-image` command. The other samples follow a similar model. For more details on the samples see the {documentation-url}/index.html#samples[samples documentation].

== Contributing

This project is in the `spring-projects-experimental` org indicating it is not as mature as other Spring projects. Contributions are welcome (please refer to the {documentation-url}/index.html#how-to-contribute[how to contribute] section).
However, please recognize we aren't at the polishing javadoc stage and whilst pre 1.0 there may be heavy evolution of APIs.

=== Baseline

The development version on `master` is currently based on GraalVM {graalvm-dev-version} and Spring Boot {spring-boot-dev-version}.
Mac, Linux and Windows are supported.
